""" You've decided to try to create a test framework that allows for easy testing of Pathfinder Ability Score arrays, 
and their validity, using 25 points.

You will write a function that takes an array of 6 scores (integers) and will return a boolean if they add up in 25 points or less.

Each score will be in range 1 <= x <= 20. You must comply with the table below, and values where x < 7 and x > 18 should return False.

Each score costs a certain amount of points. For example, a score of 16 costs 10 points, but a score of 7 would give 4 back.
